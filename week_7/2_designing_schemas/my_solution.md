## Release 5: Reflection

## I found the design of schemas fun, figuring out what to put in each table and where to connect everything was sort of like a puzzle.  In the end, I screwed up the release 4 and just did one large schema showing "one to one" and "many to many", and I unfortunately just don't have the time right this second to go back and redo the schemas, as I did them at work and would have to rebuild them from scratch.  I took inspirations from my job for what I modeled.  It was a case database for a law firm, where the primary table were the individual cases and they were joined with tables to identify the clients, the case info, the status of discovery on the evidence, and the fees owed on the case.  I am excited to learn more about building databases and navigating through them.
