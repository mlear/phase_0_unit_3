### Reflection

### I have never worked with databases before so this was quite enlightening.  I picked it up rather fast and am better at
### understanding what is going on more than being able to code it directly without assistance, but I am getting better the 
###more I do it.  I have had some trouble with the subqueries, but I don't think it will be in issue with more practice.
