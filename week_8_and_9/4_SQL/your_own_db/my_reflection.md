This was a lot easier to work with the second time around.  Most of sql, at least to me, is just getting the patterns down and then practice.  Nothing here was really shocking, everything worked the way it was supposed to.  I was super careful this time with my input in the terminal so that I wouldn't have to start from scratch multiple times.  It was a good refresher though, and I feel like I should be able to navigate simple databases without trouble.  Now, get me into something more complex and I'm sure I'll be struggling.  The things that worry me are the complex unions and joining, and being able to track everything in my head.  I'm sure I'll figure it out though, bring it on!
