## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

The first thing that jumps out at me is why bother styling inline AND have a css?  Not only will this make maintenance of the code a pain the butt, but it's also going to cause hell on a reader.  
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

The ids/classes are ok, not very descriptive, but they are there.  I think they could have been done a lot better to allow for a more through css and for the code itself to be read better.

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

My only assumption is that this page is dynamically generated using a preset template.  So, to that extent it works.  I can se it getting a lot more complicated if other tags were involved along with more css, but who knows until you try, which I certainly do not have the time for or even know how to do right this minute.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

They used both.
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

The authors used HTML tables which I haven't worked with much, so it took second to remember what the tr and td were referring to.
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

I don't think it was organized beyond, "We need something here, lets add it."  That being said, I've been guilty of that myself many times so I can't really critique.  It is not dry, but it could be with better organization and class use.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

it looks like they incorporated some design in the css that checks on what web brower is being used, but all sizes are in px and not in em.  There could certainly be scaling issues.  
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

I am personally not a big fan of the site, its very simplistic.  It looks like something that was thrown together and then forgotten about.  It has potential though and I think it could be a lot better with a little tlc.
